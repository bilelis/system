## Using Trea AI to Generate Modules

Trea AI can help you generate code for each module of this project. Follow these steps to use Trea AI effectively:

### 1. Frontend Module Generation

1. Open the project in Trea AI.
2. Type a prompt like: "Generate a React frontend for the Hotel Management System with the following features: user authentication, room booking interface, admin dashboard, and payment processing."
3. Specify any design preferences: "Use Material UI components and implement a responsive design."
4. Ask for specific components: "Create reusable components for room cards, booking forms, and user profiles."
5. Request routing setup: "Set up React Router with protected routes for authenticated users."

### 2. Backend Module Generation

1. Prompt Trea AI: "Create a Node.js/Express backend API for the Hotel Management System."
2. Specify API endpoints: "Implement RESTful endpoints for user authentication, room management, bookings, and payments."
3. Request middleware setup: "Add middleware for authentication, error handling, and request validation."
4. Ask for database integration: "Set up Sequelize ORM to connect with PostgreSQL database."
5. Request documentation: "Generate Swagger documentation for all API endpoints."

### 3. Database Module Generation

1. Prompt Trea AI: "Create database schemas and migrations for the Hotel Management System."
2. Specify entities: "Design tables for users, rooms, bookings, payments, and hotel information."
3. Request relationships: "Establish proper relationships between tables with foreign keys."
4. Ask for seed data: "Generate seed data for testing purposes."
5. Request optimization: "Implement indexes for frequently queried fields."

### 4. DevOps Module Generation

1. Prompt Trea AI: "Set up DevOps configurations for the Hotel Management System."
2. Specify CI/CD: "Create GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment."
3. Request Docker setup: "Generate Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml for containerization."
4. Ask for monitoring: "Implement logging and monitoring configurations."
5. Request deployment scripts: "Create scripts for deploying to cloud providers like AWS or Azure."

## Best Practices for Working with Trea AI

1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed requirements in your prompts.
2. **Iterative Approach**: Start with basic functionality and gradually add more complex features.
3. **Review and Refine**: Always review generated code and ask Trea AI to refine or optimize as needed.
4. **Combine Modules**: After generating individual modules, ask Trea AI to help integrate them.
5. **Testing**: Request test cases for critical functionality.

## Development Workflow

1. Generate code for each module using Trea AI.
2. Review and customize the generated code as needed.
3. Implement additional features or make adjustments.
4. Test thoroughly across all modules.
5. Deploy using the DevOps configurations.
